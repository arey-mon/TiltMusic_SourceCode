# TILT for creators: musicians, labels & services

## A gallery and marketing campaign service

Tilt allows artists, especially musicians, to create their online galleries while benefiting from a general marketplace. For an artist, an online store is as mandatory as being on social media. 
Artists can import content they have already created or work with our creative agency to build custom products. From NFTs to merchandising, we have assembled a team of experts to assist artists in designing merchandise to support their overall strategy. 

If creators already can build their content, they can easily import what they already created, whether it is digital or physical.

The galleries allow the sale of NFTs, albums, digital or physical content, and concert tickets. We help develop bundles of physical and digital products, NFTs, and the creation of collectibles.
We make it easy for consumers and fans to benefit from exclusive content, offered by their favorite artists, creating a virtuous circle and interactions throughout the year. Artists will benefit from a complete service for the sale of their works and merchandise, without scattering their products and content on various sites. 

To go further, Tilt deploys direct marketing, the benefits of which go directly to users and creators.

Artists will be able to connect their social networks to their galleries and have their latest posts appear. Thus, a user will be able to directly perform marketing actions for this artist - from liking his page to re-sharing his latest post - and earn points, to benefit from future advantages.

## An editorial support

Apart from being able to sell their products, artists need most to make themselves known. They need promotion, and to expand their audience. 

With a specialized music platform, addressing all types of audiences, with an international vocation, Tilt Music has the power to help the discovery of new artists.

In an equitable system, where each party supports the other, we wanted to put in place several systems to promote and discover new artists.

For this, we develop several processes:

- the recommendation of products on the general marketplace. These products will be labeled "favorites". An icon showing the recommendation will be displayed on the product card, and users will be able to filter the favorites of the platform via the search filter.
- a monthly newsletter. We will put forward a ranking of artists predefined according to these criteria: best audience development, best product, best sound, best album
- a quarterly livestream. For the artists that we wish to make discover to the greatest number, a live stream will be set up every quarter, which the whole Tilt community will be able to access thanks to blockchain ticketing transmitted to our users.
