# TILT for music lovers & fans

## A general marketplace for discoveries

Tilt makes it easier to be a fan! For now, the customer journey of a fan is slow and complex. Itâ€™s not so easy to find limited editions, a collector merchandising item, musical NFTs, or a freshly released album for a music lover friend. 

Tilt solves this problem by facilitating the creation of galleries for artists, and by aggregating physical and digital products in a general marketplace, including  state-of-the-art NFTs.

For now, online stores are attracting already converted fans, limiting the potential revenues of an artist, and the discoveries of music lovers. 

For all music lovers, Tilt helps the discovery of new artists by aggregating several galleries in one place, with product recommendations and highlights. 

For fans, Tilt enables them to be recognized by their favorite artist and to receive exclusive content. By making it easier for fans to benefit from exclusive content, Tilt develops a virtuous circle between fans and artists.

## A merchandising and rewarding service

Like in a video game, all actions performed on the site by users are counted and recorded, to claim various benefits. Tilt Music embeds play to earn in music, allowing fans to be rewarded, and artists to carry out large-scale operations. From the purchase of a product to the sponsoring of new members, all actions allow getting a predefined number of points.
