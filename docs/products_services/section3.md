# A Global Community

When a user achieves a new milestone and unlocks access to a private community, he receives a membership card and an email with a unique private invitation to the Discord Server, where all the benefits are listed, and where the community is interacting.

The number of points generated by an artist defines the private community to which he has access. There are 3 levels of communities. Industry professionals are invited free of charge with a distribution as follows: 

- Tier 1: Local projects
- Tier 2: International projects
- Tier 3: Global Projects

Tier 2 preserves access to Tier 1, and Tier 3 gives access to all communities.

Members can contact each other if they are on the same tier, and have private Discord chats in which they can exchange.

No matter which tier the users are in, they are all part of the Tilt community. The tiers are intended to allow professionals and artists to exchange and help each other, with common views, and to prevent too many messages to certain artists or professionals.

Beyond the autonomy that communities can have with each other, Tilt wants to offer private benefits for its community.
