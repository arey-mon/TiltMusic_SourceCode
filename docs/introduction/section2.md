# TILT Music: a game changer

With the evolution of music consumption modes, the needs of artists have changed. Creators are now more independent in the production of their albums, with the development of home studios and technological means, but also more in interaction with their fans, through social networks. 

The counterpart of this revolution is that artists no longer generate the majority of their income from album sales, but from all other products: touring, merchandising, and now NFTs. The need of the creator is thus not so much in advances for the realization of his albums, but on the construction of his career at 360 degrees. To tour, develop merchandising products, or create NFTs, a creator needs to partner with other creators, interact with their community in the most direct way possible, and have a robust online presence.

Music has always gone beyond the boundaries of sound, representing an identity, a community, an image, and a personality. A creator's success relies on his fans. It is to develop all these success vectors with and for the artists that Tilt was founded.

## Our vision: supporting musicians by supporting their fan base

An often quoted study in music NFTs is the theory of the thousand true fans. This theory, published in 2008, argues that a fan base of 1,000 people, who spend an average of $100 per year, is the foundation that allows the artist to have a sustainable, fruitful career, and to make a living entirely from their music.

This theory is a good indicator but needs to be defined to be viable. These revenues come from different markets. If we follow the statistics, these figures come to about 40% from ticketing, 35% from merchandising, and the rest from physical sales of albums, donations, synchronizations ..., and NFTs. 

All fans are different: when some want to support their favorite artist with the purchase of a collector NFT, others will prefer to go see him live or buy his latest album. It is thanks to these different markets that an artist will be able to verify the 1000 fans theory.

Supporting fans means first identifying their needs. What we observe today with social networks is that a top follower is not necessarily a consumer, and a consumer is not necessarily a top follower. How many of us follow brands that we will probably never buy? 

For an artist, identifying the fans who buy his products is essential, and social networks do not meet this need. Today, those needs are fulfilled by an online store. Unfortunately, this is not enough, and for several reasons: your posts on social networks reach less than 10% of your global audience, your website will attract only your top fans, which is usually less than 0.5% of your fanbase, the subscribers seeing your post may not be consumers, your website does not offer any interaction with your fans, nor NFTs, etc.

We have already noted that fans have different consumer profiles. A Nielsen study found that poor fan engagement is costing the music industry $450M – $2.7B annually. The study identifies 6 types of fans and assesses significant barriers to consumption for two of them. The first category of fans who would spend more is top fans. These buyers account for 40% of the music buying public and 75% of all U.S. music sales, and many of them would spend more if offered the right opportunities. The second profile identified is that of the occasional consumer, who spends between $44 and $120 per year on music.

Here are the barriers to consumption identified. For top fans, it is mainly a lack of interaction with the artist, a privileged link, access to the studio or backstage, a reward… A top fan must feel recognized, in addition to offering him unique products, why wouldn't he be rewarded by the artist directly for his support? We can create a virtuous circle, in which the artist and the fan are the primary beneficiaries.

For the second consumer profile, which could represent huge amounts of new revenues for all creators, it is simply the receipt of an offer that interests them, and the ease of use. Before, the occasional music consumer was heading to a local store, bought a few CDs for himself and friends, and a few ticket gigs very easily. Now that the consumption modes have changed, it is very hard for a basic consumer to get recommendations and find a product he likes. The online customer journey is complex: you must first identify an artist or a musical genre that you would like to discover, do online research to find this famous group, find its website, browse the offers to check if they suit you, then make the purchase - and often get redirected to other websites -, or start the whole process again if you don't have a crush on the products. Often, the artist's site is not very well polished, there are several redirections, and you have to open a parallel streaming service to listen to the music... This slows down the music consumption of millions of occasional consumers.

From these studies and observations, we can solve the brake on the purchase. For top fans, we are developing a unique reward system, from creator to fan, as well as ways to interact with their artist and even join the same private community as them. For the occasional consumer, we create a general marketplace, which recommends discoveries and allows the purchase of different products: from the concert ticket to the album, through the NFT. We bring gamification to the heart of music.

## Web3 and NFT: a technology opportunity

To gamify the music industry, and to allow artists to have a better view of their community, we use the blockchain. 

Blockchain solves many flaws inherent in the music industry such as the lack of transparency in the breakdowns, the lack of consumer data, the infinite number of intermediaries, the certificate of authenticity, the non-reproducibility of work, and the impossible counterfeiting of work or a concert ticket… And it can do even more.
NFTs are a revolution in the world of digital works because they make it possible to limit and certify a work, follow all its future transactions, and collect its income instantly.

One of the many use cases developed within the blockchain are NFTs. NFT stands for “Non-Fungible Token” broadly it represents a digital certificate of authenticity for a digital product: a video, an image, a gif. This certificate grants value to a digital product. 

In 2021, the average price of a musical NFT was around $800. This price represents twice the amount that an artist's top fans spend on average per year. It is therefore interesting to look into this aspect of collecting, but fans may feel rejected by this too speculative aspect. Therefore, for a music platform to appeal to creators, it needs to embrace all types of fans, from the casual consumer to the collector, from the tour lover to the CD lover.

When it comes to what’s possible with NFTs, we should get back to their definition. Non-fungible tokens are digital data recorded in a public database: the blockchain, and associated with a contract. These digital assets may relate to a physical or digital asset, and make it possible to guarantee their provenance and trace all their transaction history. Thus, we can use NFTs to guarantee the authenticity of a physical or digital good, but also use the NFT as a new medium for digital sales. You can also unlock new perks and utilities, like the combination or fractionalization of those NFTs, or use them as membership cards.
