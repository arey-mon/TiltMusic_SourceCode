# A gallery and marketing campaign service

Our project has no direct competitor, but it aggregates several existing solutions, such as services to create online stores, album sales sites, or NFTs marketplaces. 

We have many differentiating elements, but it is our 3-5 year vision that makes all the difference.

Our vision:

1. Individual artist stores will tend to disappear in favor of more specialized marketplaces.

Today, Universal Music in France, for example, has 250 online artist stores, more than half of which are loss-making because of structural costs. The mutualization of these costs on a general platform is therefore an exciting point for them.

There is a real challenge for independent artists: an online store only reaches converted fans, structural costs are high, there is often a need for a developer and maintenance, there is no gamification system, and products are scattered as soon as you edit ticketing or NFTs. Finally, data is not always easily extractable and complete. 

Moreover, the casual music consumer experiences a complex customer journey with the multiplication of individual artist sites and suffers from a lack of recommendations.

2. We are moving towards more community and specialized social networks.

3. It's a hybrid web2/web3 project, which can speak to the whole community of an artist, which will win the adhesion of the artists

4. When developing a project in the music sector, we must first think about the benefits of the fan, because it is through him that the career of an artist develops.

5. Finally, and from experience, most of the founders in the web3 music sector come from tech backgrounds and don't always have a good understanding of the music sector. It's a field of passionate people, where the network and the understanding of the artists' issues are very important. It is needed to understand them for the success of a project in this sector, which is above all a human sector.
